A proper APT Package Manager for jailbroken iOS 11 and up.

## But what is it really?

Sileo is the next generation of jailbreaking. With other package managers for jailbroken iOS devices being outdated and not fully functional without patches and modifications, we knew that it was time for a new APT-based package manager to fill the gap.

Sileo is made with love, not just in California, but by people from all over the world.
